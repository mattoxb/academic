I teach the following courses. 

- [CS 421: Programming Languages](teaching/cs421-programming-languages)
- [CS 491 CAP: Competitive Algorithmic Programming](teaching/cs421cap-competitive-algorithmic-programming)
- [Eng 598 TL (Cross listed with CS 591 TA)](teaching/eng598tl-teaching-and-leadership)
- CS 296-25: Data Structures Honors Section

I usually flip my classroom if possible, and during the "lecture" time have the students work on a
[POGIL](project/pogil) activity.  Currently I am experimenting
with [Specifications Grading](project/specifications-grading)
It is a bit of an adjustment, but so far I like it.
