I teach the following courses. 

- [CS 421: Programming Languages](https://pages.github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs421-sp21/web/)
- [CS 491 CAP: Competitive Algorithmic Programming](https://pages.github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs491cap/web-sp21/)
- [Eng 598 TL (Cross listed with CS 591 TA)](https://publish.illinois.edu/eng-ielite/)
- CS 296-25: Data Structures Honors Section

I usually flip my classroom if possible, and during the "lecture" time have the students work on a
[POGIL](https://pogil.org) activity.  Currently I am experimenting
with [Specifications Grading](https://styluspub.presswarehouse.com/browse/book/9781620362426/Specifications-Grading).
It is a bit of an adjustment, but so far I like it.
