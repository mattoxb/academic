Since the spring of 2017, the Integrated Engineering Leadership Initiative for
Teaching Excellence (iELITE) team has been developing and offering a course
that seeks to train graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) in the College of
Engineering. The training is to be applicable to all types of GTA contexts:
lab, discussion, and lecture. Because many of our engineering students' career
goals are within non-academic settings, students often have little natural
motivation to develop effective pedagogical skills. As explained in our
previous paper, the team made a strategic decision to combine the teaching of
leadership skills and pedagogical skills in order to appeal to GTAs who plan to
go into non-academic careers. In this paper, we will present our logic model
for the iELITE program, which has four categories of inputs: GTAs, Engineering
Faculty, Administration (College and Departments), and External Partners
(industry sponsors). The logic model will lay out corresponding short-term,
intermediate-term and long-term outcomes for each of the categories. The
External Partners category is a new addition to the program this year. After
collecting feedback from the teaching community in the college, we think that
it is crucial to connect our content to what is being done in the professional
workplace to make the learning experience more realistic. Intermediate-term
outcomes in the GTAs category will be our main focus for the moment.
Furthermore, we will discuss faculty feedback from those who have worked with
past GTA participants in the program.
