CS 421 is an upper level undergraduate course / lower level graduate course in programming languages, and I consider
it my ``flagship'' course.  It has four major components: functional programming, parsing, mathematical foundations,
and pragmatics.  This class is important to me because it is one of very few courses at our institution where students
learn functional programming.  My approach to the class is to spend the first third teaching them a functional programming
language, and then show them how to write interpreters for several languages with it.  I tell them that before the class
they were consumers of programming languages, but afterwards they can be producers if the want to.

I use the [Haskell](https://haskell.org) as the implementation language, for a few reasons.  First, it was developed by
the programming language community to experiment with language implementation.  Second, the combination of features like
type inference, lazy evaluation, and type classes make Haskell code amazingly concise and elegant.  Third, Haskell makes
heavy use of monads, which have been described as one of the most important programming language constructs to be
developed in 20 years.  Students are not likely to use Haskell in the work-force, but features of Haskell end up
influencing other languages.  Students often email me years later to tell me how they are making use of what they
learned in this course.

One of my goals is to show my students how learning new programming languages, especially new programming language
paradigms, has similar effects as learning new human languages.  It creates a realization of ways of thinking about
programming that would be difficult or impossible to imagine otherwise.
